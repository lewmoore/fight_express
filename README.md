# Fight Express

This is a side project that I will be slowly adding to which is inspired by
the Battle Application Project from Makers Academy course.

This application will be written in Javascript using Node and Express. Testing
will be done with Jasmine, Mocha and Chai.

# Specifications:
* I want to be able to create a fighter and view my health
* I want to be able to select what weapon my fighter has
* I want to be able to fight against a computer as an opponent
* I want to attack my opponent, be attacked and either win or lose a game
* I want to be able to save my progress and log out of the game
